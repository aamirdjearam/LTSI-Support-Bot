# LTSI-Support-Bot

## Introduction

After working with the LTSI (Learning and Support Technology and Innovation) team at UVIC, I came to realize the sheer amount of people power required to organize and respond to tickets accordingly. I had suggested during a meeting that we create a sort of fillable form instead of the e-mail system that we use but recently came up with the idea of making a support bot for the UVic Support website instead.

This bot will be powered using Amazon Lex and be roughly based on the [Amazon Lex Support Bot Tutorial](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-lex-support-bot/edit/master/README.md) although this specific bot will also incorporate a lambda function that ties into SNS and possibly even Amazon Connect (depending on time constraints)

Before I start, I'd like to acknowledge the creators of the original AWS Support Bot Guide: Rumi Olsen (rumi@amazon.com) and Ryan Vanderwerf (ryvan@amazon.com)

Lets go over the components used in this bot:

#### Amazon Lex

#### Amazon Polly

#### Lambda

#### S3
