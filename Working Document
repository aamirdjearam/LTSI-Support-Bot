This document is to show my thinking process and how I plan on working through the problem

First step would be designing an inital statement. The initial statement should be the decision between the request being sent to the helpdesk or to LTSI. 

The bot will have to hook up into UVIC's support website so it will have to be web-friendly

To maintain accordance with UVIC's accessibility policy, we will integrate Amazon Polly and Transcribe into the bot so that we can use speech to text and text to speech

First step would be creating an IAM acess role for the bot

Second Step would be creating a S3 bucket to hold the bot's properties.
